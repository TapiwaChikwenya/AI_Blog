</div><p><a href="https://www.swift.vc/">Swift Ventures</a> has unveiled a new <a href="https://www.swift.vc/ai_index">artificial intelligence company index</a> today, creating the first systematic scoring system to identify public companies making genuine investments in AI technology rather than just talking about it in earnings calls.</p>



<p>The venture capital firm developed the index by fine-tuning large language models to analyze thousands of earnings transcripts, hiring data, and research contributions. The analysis revealed that while companies mentioned AI over 16,000 times in last quarter&#x2019;s earnings calls, only a small fraction are making substantial investments in the technology.</p>



<div/><p>&#x201c;Everyone sees that the world&#x2019;s changing &#x2014; AI is changing the world, but most people, they just don&#x2019;t have a way to partake in the upside,&#x201d; said Brett Wilson, cofounder of Swift Ventures, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &#x201c;They can&#x2019;t invest in private companies like I do as a VC, and it&#x2019;s just not easy to find true AI companies beyond just buying Nvidia or the Magnificent Seven.&#x201d;</p>



<h2>How top AI companies are crushing market returns: New performance data</h2>



<p>The index currently tracks approximately 90 companies and uses three primary metrics: investment in AI research and open-source contributions, AI talent density, and revenue derived from AI operations.</p>



<p>Companies that meet the criteria for inclusion in the index have demonstrated remarkable market performance, with the index showing 37% annual growth over the past three years, substantially outperforming both the Nasdaq&#x2019;s 12% and the S&amp;P&#x2019;s 19% growth during the same period.</p>



<p>Perhaps most striking is the correlation between research investment and profitability. Wilson noted, &#x201c;When we looked at companies that are regularly contributing to AI research and open-source models, you see it reflected in their profitability. Those companies have an average gross profit of something like double regular tech companies that don&#x2019;t &#x2014; 55% versus 25%.&#x201d;</p>



<h2>The AI talent crisis: Why only 1% of public companies are winning the hiring race</h2>



<p>The index reveals a stark talent gap in public markets. According to Swift&#x2019;s analysis, only about 200 public companies maintain more than 1% of their workforce in AI-specific roles, despite widespread claims about AI adoption. This metric has become increasingly important as the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2023/beyond-bls/artificial-intelligence-and-firm-level-labor-and-organizational-dynamics.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> projects unprecedented demand for AI engineers.</p>



<p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t just talk about AI and be an AI company,&#x201d; Wilson emphasized. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about making investments in AI talent and infrastructure and research and contributing to the community.&#x201d;</p>



<h2>Inside Swift Ventures&#x2019; game-changing plan to transform AI investment</h2>



<p>The index has identified several under-the-radar companies making significant AI investments, including <a href="https://www.doximity.com/">Doximity</a>, which develops AI-powered medical writing applications, and <a href="https://www.leidos.com/">Leidos</a>, which focuses on defense-oriented autonomous systems. These companies are &#x201c;growing over 50% per year,&#x201d; according to Wilson, suggesting a broader AI transformation beyond well-known tech leaders.</p>



<p>Swift Ventures plans to make the index available for free with quarterly updates and is considering launching an ETF in early 2025 if investor interest materializes. The firm&#x2019;s approach represents a significant shift from existing AI investment vehicles, focusing on programmatic scoring rather than individual stock picking.</p>



<p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want to look like something like a <a href="https://www.ark-funds.com/funds/arkk">Kathy Wood</a>&#x2018;s vehicle, where someone&#x2019;s cherry-picking certain stocks,&#x201d; Wilson explained. &#x201c;Our intention was to use kind of a programmatic criteria to pick companies, and have the system do it.&#x201d;</p>



<p>The index launch comes at a critical moment for AI investment, as public market investors struggle to differentiate between companies making <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai">meaningful AI investments</a> and those simply adopting AI terminology. It also arrives as private AI companies like <a href="https://www.databricks.com/">Databricks</a>, <a href="https://scale.com/">Scale AI</a> and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a> prepare for potential public offerings in the coming years, suggesting the AI company landscape could shift dramatically.</p>



<p>This new methodology has the potential to become a standard benchmark for evaluating AI investments, potentially influencing how companies allocate resources to AI development and how investors measure AI capabilities in public markets.</p>



<p>For corporate leaders, the index provides clear metrics for what constitutes genuine AI investment. As Wilson noted, &#x201c;Real AI investment means that you have a preponderance of AI people, that you&#x2019;re investing in AI research, contributing it to the community, and that your revenue is fundamentally affected by those AI investments.&#x201d;</p>
