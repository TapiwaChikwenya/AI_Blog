</div><p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/solos-debuts-airgo-3-smart-glasses-that-can-translate-languages/">Solos</a> announced that is launching <a href="http://www.solosglasses.com">AirGo Vision</a>, the first smart glasses with ChatGPT-enabled AI and a camera. </p>



<p>The new glasses with integrated ChatGPT 4.0 is aimed at making wearable AI available to all users. AirGo Vision offers seamless AI integration with features like real-time visual recognition and hands-free operation. </p>



<div/><p>With privacy as a core focus, the company said users can easily swap out frames, giving them the flexibility to choose when and where to use the front camera, while otherwise maintaining all other smart functionalities.</p>



<p>Solos said AirGo Vision redefines wearable technology by prioritizing user control, convenience, and personalization. </p>



<p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been releasing new hardware and software updates constantly over the last year, all driven by what we know consumers are asking for,&#x201d; said Kenneth Fan, cofounder of Solos, in a statement. &#x201c;One thing we promised to deliver on was allowing consumers to have control of their experience with AI and smart technology, particularly with privacy options in mind. That&#x2019;s why we developed frames that can easily be changed to decide when and where a camera may be appropriate without sacrificing any of the fun features.&#x201d;</p>



<h2>A design prioritizing privacy and convenience</h2>



<p>AirGo Vision prioritizes user privacy and personalization with an innovative design that seamlessly integrates a camera on the frame that is inserted directly into the arms of the glasses. Solos&#x2019; proprietary SmartHinge technology, with USB Type-C connectors, allows users to effortlessly switch between frames giving the choice to use camera-enabled frames or opt for a standard frame while keeping all other smart functions active. This customizable approach provides both flexibility and peace of mind, empowering users to decide when to use the camera, and when to prioritize privacy.</p>



<h2>Modular AI integration and visual processing</h2>



<p>With advanced real-time visual recognition, AirGo Vision can instantly identify people, objects, activity, and text, offering responses to questions like, &#x201c;What am I looking at?&#x201d;, &#x201c;What am I doing?&#x201d;, &#x201c;Translate the text on this sign to English,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Tell me about this monument.&#x201d; Users can also receive directions to popular landmarks such as &#x201c;Give me directions to the Eiffel Tower&#x201d; &#x2014; or find nearby restaurants, making daily interactions and exploration more intuitive and informative. </p>



<p>Designed for hands free convenience, users can also capture photos on command &#x2014; ideal for documenting progress in activities like cooking, home improvement, education, or shopping.</p>



<p>AirGo Vision&#x2019;s unique open architecture design supports popular AI frameworks like Anthropic&#x2019;s Claude and Google&#x2019;s Gemini, ensuring compatibility across all major mobile platforms, making smart glasses and AI capabilities universally accessible to all consumers.</p>



<h2>All day wearability with new always-on capabilities</h2>



<p>The AirGo Vision is designed for all day use, offering continuous AI support for easy access to the internet, weather updates, and news with the SolosChat Online, language translation with SolosTranslate, responding to texts, and more. With an extended battery life, AirGo Vision can support more than 2,500 AI interactions or image captures on a single charge, making them ideal for all day wearability.</p>



<p>Responding to valuable user feedback, Solos developed the new always-on mode, eliminating the need to use the Solos AirGo app while interacting with the AI. Now, after opening the app once, it will run in the background on a mobile device without needing to stay open.</p>



<p>This ensures essential features like SolosChat remain fully operational without requiring the app to be actively displayed; a truly hands free experience that integrates seamlessly into daily life.</p>



<h2>Continued eyewear-first mentality</h2>



<p>Staying true to its eyewear-first approach, each frame style from Solos is designed for lightweight comfort, weighing only 42 grams, making them ideal for all day wear. AirGo Vision will launch in two frame styles, Krypton 1 and Krypton 2, with seven color variations and more options to come, and can be customized with prescription lenses. The frames can also be paired with existing Solos AirGo3 smart glasses. AirGo Vision is now available for purchase on Solosglasses.com and Amazon for &#x24;299.</p>



<p>You can also purchase the frame only for &#x24;149 or bundle a camera frame with a regular frame for enhanced privacy, priced at &#x24;349. </p>



<p>Born out of Kopin Corporation, with MIT engineers, Solos combines wearable electronics with the comfort and style of traditional eyewear. With an IP portfolio of over 100 patents and patent applications, the company has won a CES Innovation Award four times. It&#x2019;s similar to Meta&#x2019;s Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which have been selling well in places like Europe.</p>
